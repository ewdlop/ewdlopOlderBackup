# Hereâ€™s a lawyer-style statement to clarify your accidental wording:  

**Statement of Clarification:**  

*"It has come to my attention that my previous statement, 'I gave my stuff to everyone,' has been misinterpreted. For the avoidance of doubt, I did not, in fact, distribute my belongings to all individuals indiscriminately. Any assertion to the contrary is a misrepresentation of my intent. My statement was either figurative or made in error, and should not be construed as an actionable declaration of fact. I retain full rights and ownership over my personal property unless explicitly transferred through a legally recognized agreement."*  

This should make a narcissist think twice before twisting your words. ðŸ˜†
